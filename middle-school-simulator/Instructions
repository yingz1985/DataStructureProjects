You have just been hired as part of a team of elite developers to work on the next video game craze: Middle School Simulator. 
It will be your job to simulate the lunch line of Rocky Stream Middle School. 
Rocky Stream middle school is a weird place, with some weird constraints. 
First of all, the lunch line can only hold up to 20 people at once,
and any overflowing people will find themselves loitering in the hallway without a hall pass 
and be immediately sent to detention, by the Dean, Mr. Mean. 
Just like a normal lunch line, students who arrive usually go to the back of the line.
However, if a student sees a friend on the lunch line, they may choose to cut in front of the friend, 
so you must allow for this. Furthermore, students may choose to switch places on line 
(usually, a spot will be traded if the student moving forward promises the student moving backward their soggy fries). 
A student will be removed from the front of the line once he/she has been served by the lunch lady, Mystery Meat Martha. 
There is also a resident bully, Punchin' Patrick, who may walk up to any student and steal their lunch money. 
Students may also drop lunch money accidentally or pick some up off of the floor, 
so you must be able to update a student's lunch money balance. 
Once a student has no lunch money, they will leave the line. 
Additionally, as your target demographic will be indecisive tweens that might want to come up with realities in their middle school game,
you will make the option to switch between two different realities (each with its own separate lunch line), 
and copy a reality to the other (to have a starting point where two scenarios can be made) (array copy), 
in case your game players decide they don't like the way they have manipulated the story thus far. 
You will write a program that simulates this lunch line from the command line.
