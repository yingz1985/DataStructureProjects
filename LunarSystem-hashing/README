Lunar System allows the user to interact with a database of Students

Provides the user with a menu-based interface that allows them to add, remove, and edit Students, as well as their courses. 
Users can either enter as the administrator when logging in with the user name: "REGISTRAR" or "WebID" to register 
students into the system( NOTE*: you can only log in as a student once the administrator registers your name)
or enter as a student to manipulate his/her courses.

The database can be either saved(data is saved and reloaded the next time system runs) or not saved(all previous data deleted, 
and the system will start over again the next time the system runs).
