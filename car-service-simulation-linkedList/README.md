Tony's Discount Oil Change in Hicksville has just made a landmark tax-evasion and is looking to modernize its computer system
with the profits.Tony only services on cars made by Ford, GMC, Chevy, Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, and Lincoln.Tony has gotten old,
so he doesn't do oil changes, only paperwork; therefore, he's hired two mechanics, Donny and Joe, to do the oil changes for 
him. Each one of them has a list of cars they must do the oil change for, and when a new customer comes, they're usually added
to the end of the list for their preferred mechanic. However, if the customer is in a rush, or pays a bit extra, they can have
their car placed anywhere in the list. 
Donny and Joe may also choose to work out of turn on cars, rearrange their lists, or swap cars between their lists.
Tony can record this using a cut-paste function where he can cut the car and either move it forward or backward, 
or paste it in the list of jobs for Donny or Joe. 
Additionally, sometimes, cars cannot be serviced due to technical reasons, 
so Tony must be able to remove cars if he discovers a problem while inspecting them later. 
Sometimes, Donny or Joe may call in sick due to a medical condition called Hangoveritis Extremis. 
In case this happens, Donny and Joe's lists must be merged in the following way: D1, J1, D2, J2, etc.
When a car is done being serviced, it is placed on the ready for pickup list
