This UNO game is designed to be a computer vs. player game. It is a smaller re-themed version of Uno featuring popular kids' TV characters in Sesame Street,
It includes 36 cards, 1 to 7, draw 2, all in colors of Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, and four wild cards. 
Game play is similar to ordinary Uno. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of five cards.
Players take turns discarding cards by matching the most recent discard in color or number. 
This version includes different characters for each number so that characters could also be matched.
A player with one card remaining must yell Uno or draw two cards.
Players without a matching card must draw one card from the draw stack. 
If the drawn card matches, it may be played immediately, otherwise the player's turn ends. 
The two special cards are the wild which permit a player to name a color for the next card to be played
and the draw two which forces the next player to pick up two cards and lose their turn.
The goal is to be the first player to discard all the cards in their hand.
